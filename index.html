  <p>
    Ramon Branch Biescas was born in Tarragona, Spain in 2001. Starting music at a young age he attended
    the choir school Escolania de Montserrat in Catalonia where he had most of his early musical training.
    There he studied piano with Vicenç Prunés for four years and organ with Merce Sanchís for three years.
    The choir performed in Russia, France, the United States, Poland, Germany, China and many different
    areas in Catalonia. Later he moved to the UK to continue his musical career and his academic studies
    at Lancing College, where he had organ lessons with Neil Cox and piano lessons with Adrian West.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ramon started the tuba at the age of fourteen with Dave Whitson and a year later joined the Junior
    Royal Academy of Music to study with Stephen Wick. After completing his GCSEs, he went to the Purcell
    School for Young Musicians to continue his musical career as a tuba player without neglecting his other
    instruments. There he improved as an all-rounded musician and enjoyed many varied performing opportunities.
    He achieved a high distinction mark in all his grade 8 ABRSM exams and hopes to achieve his diploma in
    singing and organ in the future.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ramon has had a considerable amount of experience playing with orchestras such as the London Symphony
    Orchestra, London Lawyers Symphony Orchestra, Fidelio Symphony Orchestra, Junior Academy Symphony Orchestra,
    Purcell School Symphony, Jove Orchestra National de Catalunya and the Guildhall Symphony Orchestra.
    He is currently studying with Ben Thomson, the principal tubist at the London Symphony Orchestra and
    Kevin Morgan, the principal tubist of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. He has been keen to continue with
    his other musical talents and is having second study singing lessons with Adrian Thompson, while also
    singing at St Mary’s Hendon as a choral scholar and playing the organ in different churches around London.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ramon is also very keen on chamber music, playing regularly with the Heron Brass Quintet, who recently
    reached the semifinal round for the Royal Overseas League competition. Having now completed his master’s
    studies, he is looking forward to continuing his career as a freelance musician and teacher.
